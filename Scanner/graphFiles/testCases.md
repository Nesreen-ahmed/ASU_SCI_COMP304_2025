### Test Cases
  - `(1,2),(1,red), (4,2),(5,green),(3,yellow)`
      - > In this case the scanner should give an error because there is no **space** in our language (Automaton)!
      - > But the scanner will still be able to understand the graph input if it ignores this **space**, so you need to modify your code to ignore the space if it is found!
  - `(1,2),(1,red),(34,2),(25,green),(3,yellow)`
      - > Make sure that this entry should consider that `34` is a number and not `3` is a number and `4` is a number.
        
  - `(1,2),(1,red),(34,2),(25,green),(3,yello`
       - > Make sure this entry should give an error!

> Please, write your own code!

> [!NOTE]
> You don't need to write the Doctors's code, your code must be unique from anyone else's "your Doctors, your friends" - just your own code!

> [!NOTE]
> I expect to read 20 different codes in the next lab.
